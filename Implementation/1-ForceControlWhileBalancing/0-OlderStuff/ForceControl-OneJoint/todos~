todos:

1. Read the identification paper again and decide the trajectories you want to implement (30 min)
2. Write a code that:
	a. Runs the motor through a specific trajectory (1.5 hour)
	b. Logs the relevant states throughout the trajectory (1.5 hour)
3. From the logged data perform the post-processing (1 hour)
4. Through linear regression find the parameters (1 hour)
	Things defered for later:
		Try reversing the side of the motor and then measure the variables. See whether they correspond.
5. Read the force-control methodology of Khateeb (3 hours)
6. Make a plan to write a code to implement khateeb's methodology (30 min)
7. Write the code step-by-step (5 hours)
	Write a code that does not send velocity or position commands to the rest of the six motors and allows current control for motor 4
		Go to pciod and do a hack there which ignores the velocity commands on motor 4
	Write a code for current-based position control of motor 4 based on the dynamic model
	Extend the code to do force control
		Sense the gravity compensated relevant component of the force
		Control it
8. Live/play with the system (2 hours)
9. Record a demo (2 hours)
