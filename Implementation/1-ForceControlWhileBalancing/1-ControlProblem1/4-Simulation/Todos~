three platforms: 
	DART
	MATLAB
	Stanford's

==============
DART:
1. Collect as much documentation as possible for DART
2. Read about its installation and usage
3. Install
4. Use

- Simulation by the student last Fall'
- Loading of the model
- How can I insert my own dynamic model in it

===============

Can had made some krang-specific changes to dart and had made a copy in the Software/project/dart folder.
I am attempting to install that version of dart on my computer.
I start by doing a "git pull" in that folder. then i will

- cd build ... cmake .. .... make all install 
- there will be dependency problems. I will install dependencies one by one
- will look into how to use dart and grip to my purposes
- look into the dynamic simulation that can mentioned in the discussion of full body of krang
- look how i can modify the software to simulate the equations that i have derived

================

done git pull 
moved the build folder in the Documents/Software/project/dart/ to ...stableForceInteraction/.../4-Simulation/ directory just in case I will need the build directory again.
created a build directory and run cmake on it ..
got the error:
CMake Error: your CXX compiler: "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND" was not found.   Please set CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to a valid compiler path or name.
The internet gave me the following solution:
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y 
error resolved.

Doing "sudo apt-get install libflann-dev" removes the flann problem
libccd was not able to be installed

==============

I checked the installation links on dartsim wiki. Got something useful:
dart 3.0 requires:
    OpenGL libraries
    libassimp3, libassimp-dev (>=3.0)
    libeigen3-dev
    libboost-all-dev (=1.46 if precise or =1.49 if quantal)
    flann (>=1.8)
    libccd (>=1.4)
    libfcl (>=0.2.7, compiled with boost 1.46 in precise and 1.49 in quantal) libraries
    urdfdom_headers
    urdfdom
    console_bridge

dart 4.0 requires:
DART requires the following dependencies:

    Mandatory
        OpenGL libraries
        libassimp3, libassimp-dev (>=3.0)
        libeigen3-dev
        libboost-all-dev (=1.46 if precise or =1.49 if quantal)
        flann (>=1.8)
        libccd (>=1.4)
        libfcl (>=0.2.7, compiled with boost 1.46 in precise and 1.49 in quantal) libraries
        urdfdom_headers
        urdfdom
        console_bridge
    Optional
        nlopt
        ipopt
        snopt

dart 4.1 requires:
DART requires the following dependencies:

    Mandatory for core
        OpenGL libraries
        libassimp3, libassimp-dev (>=3.0)
        libeigen3-dev
        libboost-all-dev (=1.46 if precise or =1.49 if quantal)
        libccd (>=1.4)
        libfcl (>=0.2.7, compiled with boost 1.46 in precise and 1.49 in quantal) libraries
    Mandatory for non-core
        flann (>=1.8)
        urdfdom_headers
        urdfdom
        console_bridge
    Optional
        libbullet-dev (>=2.81)
        nlopt
        ipopt
        snopt

======
Turns out that the version of libboost I had installed was greater than 1.46 so I had to remove it using "sudo apt-get --purge remove libboost-dev libboost-doc" and install libboost manually from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.46.0/". Followed the steps on "file:///home/munzir/Downloads/boost_1_46_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html" to install it. They were as follows:
1. unzip the downloaded folder
2. cd ~/Downloads/boost_1_46_0
3. sudo ./bootstrap --prefix=/usr/local/
4. sudo ./bjam install
Once done I created a new build folder in Dart and did "cmake .." and the boost version detected was 1.46
=====
The version of flann is also incorrect. The one installed is 1.7. While we need >=1.8. So "sudo apt-get --purge remove libfalnn-dev libflann1" removed the existing version and then I downloaded version 1.8.4 from the website "http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/". It was a simple cmake build and install procedure. The dart cmake when rebuilt detected this version of flann.
=====
Installed libccd using "git clone https://github.com/dartsim/libccd" inside the Downloads folder, it created a libccd folder within this folder. Then within hte folder a simple cmake installation did the job.
