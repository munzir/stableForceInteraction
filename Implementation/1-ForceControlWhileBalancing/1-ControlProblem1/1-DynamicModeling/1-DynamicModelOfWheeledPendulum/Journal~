So I am returning to the work after 8 weeks of running away.

Trying to figure out what's going on. 

Looks like the tree structure model is done

But the pendulum equations are a mess. A lot of things seem to be unexplained.

Also it appears that errors in my analysis will grow as I move forward.

Trying to figure out the model with more accuracy requires me to dig deeper into the
reasons for current errors. 

Also things to be done for moving forwards should be understood completely so that 
I have confidence in completing this work.

Todos:

1- Dig a bit deeper to figure out the problems with pendulum equations
2- Understand the theory of rotor inertia properly before moving forward
3- understand the effect of forces
4- understand friction
5- combining the two
-----
6- non-linearities in the actual robot
7- brakes
8- parameter guesstimation
9- parameter estimation
10- simulation

I'm hating it. What do I do?
Organize this stuff in your mind. So what's going on. You derived pendulum equations using your own method. This thing
has tons of variables that look yucky. Try to go through each and understand all of them.
Then you had derived a model in an earlier work without spin. And then there are two other works being refered here
each having its own assumptions about symmetry and its own method of derivation. In order to understand the error you will
have to show where the extra terms in our work or in their work come from. This requires.
