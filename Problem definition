Actual research:
================
What is the objective of the solution:

Intelligent decision making for avoiding situations of disbalance in the event of large change 
in external force

Possible framework:
1-Predict the situation (an upcoming sudden change of force)
------------------------------------------------------------
	Two cases:
	I) A present large force about to go away (P1. how do we predict this?)
	II) A sudden large force about to be applied (P2. how do we predict this?)

2-Once predicted, identify whether it is avoidable, if yes take the action
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Case I: If the force is about to go away, 
	-----------------------------------------
	- Can we make this going away of the force controlled and slow (P3a. How to determine 
	  this? P4a. Once determined, how to do this?)
	- Can we change our own pose so that it minimizes the unstability about to be caused
	  due to this change of force. (P5a How to determine this P6a. Once determined how to 
	  do this?)
	- Can we take help from a neighboring object to take support in order to counter the
          sudden change of the force (P7a. How to determine this? P8a. Once determined how to do 
	  this?)

	Case II: If the force is about to be applied
	-------------------------------------------
	- Can we make this change controlled and slow (P3a. How to determine this? P4a. Once 
          determined how to do this?)
	- Can we change our own pose so that the instability due to this change is minimized
	  (P5a How to determine this P6a. Once determined how to do this?)
	- Can we take help from a neighboring object to take support in order to counter the
          sudden change of the force (P7a. How to determine this? P8a. Once determined how to do 
	  this?)

4-More intellgent control in the event of a predicted change of force
---------------------------------------------------------------------
What was done previously was preparation for the change. Now is the time of the actual event. 
Use a better control strategy in the presence of a force-change prediction? (P9. How to do this?)

5-If not avoidable prevent the situation from happening, find alternatives to execute the same task
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raise flags! Sound buzzers! Refuse to act! 
In case the higher level decision making is in our hands, find the alternative!


Problem List:
=============
1. How to predict a large force currently being sensed is about to go away?
	1.1 In the presence of a sensed external force, how do we know whether or not its 
	    manipulation is enitrely within our sphere of control?
	1.2 How to determine, based on an intended future action, what the magnitude of 
	    force changes is going to be?
	1.3 How to perceive the intention of an external agent as to whether he is about 
	    to make the force change?
2. How to predict a large force is about to be applied to the robot?
	2.1 How to determine, based on an intended future action, what is going to be the change 
	    in external force?
	2.2 How to perceive whether an external agent intends to apply a sudden force?
3. How to determine whether the force change can be controlled?
4. How to control force change?
5. How to determine whether the pose can be changed to minimize instability due to the upcoming 
   force change?
6. How to change the pose to minimize instability due to an upcoming force change?
7. How to determine whether help can be taken from a neighboring object to counter an upcoming
   sudden change of force?
8. How to take help from a neighboring object to counter an upcoming force change?
9. How to change the control strategy in anticipation of a predicted force change to achieve
   better stability?

Five Realistic Solvable Issues
==============================
1. How to determine, based on an intended future action, what the magnitude of force changes 
   is going to be? (P1.2 and P2.1)
2. How to control force change? (P4, ->P3)
3. How to change the pose to minimize instability due to an upcoming force change?
4. How to take help from a neighboring object to counter an upcoming force change? (P6, ->P5)
5. How to change the control strategy in anticipation of a predicted force change to achieve
   better stability? (P9)

Immediate Todos to create an experimental setup (development tasks):
====================================================================
1-Making the current force-responsive balancing stable
	Tune the time delay of the filter
2-Try to get a nice representative MATLAB simulation of the system
	More parameter estimation (Inertia of body/wheel/motor axis, coeff of frictions)
3-Allow the system to change its gains online based on the change in the pose
4-Study the problem of force changing in Simulation and on the real robot
