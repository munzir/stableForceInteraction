P7. How to determine whether help can be taken from a neighboring object to counter an upcoming
    sudden change of force?
================================================================================================
The solution to this problem will only be devised once we know the math of P8 (i.e. How to take
help from a neghboring object). Once we know how to do it we will know whether or not it can be 
done!
