How to predict a large force currently being sensed is about to go away:
========================================================================
--If no large force is currently being sensed, this event is not going to occur.

--If the force is being sensed, then (P1.1: How to determine these three cases?):
	I) It may be entirely within the sphere of control of the robot e.g. the robot is holding 
	   on to something or the robot is carrying a weight
	II) It may be enitirely outside the cotrol of the robot e.g. some intelligent agent is pushing 
	   or pulling on to the robot
	III) It may be partially within the robot's sphere of control and partially outside his shpere
	   of control e.g. carrying a load with the help of another intelligent agent

	In Case I:
	If the force is in the sphere of control of the robot then the robot can predict when this force change
	is going to occur if the robot is aware of his intentions (he is deliberating himself about the actions
	and is not being teleoperated). In this case the intended future action of the robot is going to 
	determine whether the force change will occur or not. For example, if the robot is about to release
	a heavy object, or the robot is about to release something that he was holding on to. (P1.2: How to
	determine this?)

	In Case II:
	If the force is entirely outside the sphere of control of the robot, then the robot can try to perceive 
	the intentions of the enternal agent in order to try to determine the force change. This problem is
	hard and always prone to failure of perception (P1.3: How to do this?). So in this case the robot should 
	always be ready for the change of force to occur at any time. (This will be dealt with in P3-8).

	In Case III:
	This case will follow a combined strategy of both case I and II.

List of subproblems:
--------------------
P1.1 In the presence of a sensed external force, how do we know whether or not its manipulation is enitrely within
out sphere of control?
P1.2 How to determine, based on an intended future action, what the magnitude of force changes is going to be?
P1.3 How to perceive the intention of an external agent as to whether he is about to make the force change?
