P5. How to determine whether the pose can be changed to minimize instability due to the upcoming 
   force change?
===============================================================================================
The solution to this problem will only be devised once we know the math of P6 (i.e. How to change
pose to minimize instability). Once we know how to do it we will know whether or not it can be done!
