How to predict a large force is about to be applied to the robot?
=================================================================
This force may be either:
I) Due to an action to be initiated by the robot e.g. robot is about to lift a heavy object
II) Due to action to be initiated by an external agent e.g. some agents is going to put some
heavy object in the arms of the robot

In Case I:
----------
The robot has to assess his future actions in terms of force interactions in order to determine
whether a force change is about to occur (P2.1 How to determine this?)

In Case II:
-----------
The robot needs to perceive the intentions of the external agent to predict the future force
interactions (P2.2 How to do this?). This is obviously a very hard problem!

List of Subproblems:
====================
P2.1 How to determine, based on an intended future action, what is going to be the change in 
external force?
P2.2 How to perceive whether an external agent intends to apply a force?
